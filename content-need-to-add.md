How is consent to store data handled?



Is there version control and auditability built in to the backend of the Controlled Document System? (i.e. Can I see when the last update was? Can I look at historic versions of the same document?)

Can documents be tagged with accreditation standards – making them easier to search? 
Is there any way of accessing other organisations Controlled Document Register with their permission? (i.e. On PROMPT as an administer I can access the likes of Alfred Health’s Controlled Document Register)

Can reports be pulled from the system to demonstrate how many controlled documents have been updated or the activity on the system (i.e. Most searched document for a period)?  
Finally, In scheduling the establishment of our PHN in a Box is it dependent on the Controlled Document System being set up early to inform other parts of the system? In other words given the backlog of updates currently being completed on our controlled documents what are the behind the scenes dependencies of the system to get the Controlled Document System migrated as soon as possible

"How do we ‘categorise’ organisations and people so that we can create reports (or other outputs) that list these groups of people? 
For example; “GPs in the Geelong region”, “Aged Care workers who have expiring accreditation”."

When do we use a survey/form to collect data, where is it stored, and can we search / report on this data in relation to a person and/or organisation?
For short term data collection, for example a trial project involving stakeholders, what is the best process to record this temporary chunk of information so that it remains historically accessible and extractable in reporting, such as a graphical representation of a timeline of events?

What attributes need to be populated in AD for staff?

What are the minimum attributes required to add a person into Dynamics?

Can we search and report from the ‘activity feed’ (aka. Notes in ChilliDB)?
What Dynamics APIs and other integrations currently in use by Murray (or Darling Downs)?
How do we transfer our existing relationship history, notes, event attendances, file attachments etc?

Does Dynamics store consent information, including consent to collect and store information as well as specific usage of that information (newsletters, event reminders, invitations, surveys)?

WVPHN records our members of the company in ChilliDB, how does Dynamics manage PHN company membership? Is this as simple as a ‘is member’ custom attribute for organisations / people that can then show additional fields such as dates, member type, number etc

"Are there extra considerations we need to make regarding sequencing of data preparation by standing up the PHN Exchange before the PHN in a box to reduce risk and maintain data quality?
