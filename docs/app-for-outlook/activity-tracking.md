# Activity Tracking in Outlook

Emails, Appointments and Calls have a default field called ‘regarding’. This allows staff to select a record in CRM that the activity relates to. Reporting of activity based on topic can then be generated, and activities will also appear on those records if they are ‘regarding’ it.

How your PHN wishes to track activities is up to you – it is relatively easy to configure which entities can be used in the ‘regarding’ field. 

There is a medium level of staff training that will be required, as well as strategies to ensure staff are actively tracking activities. Tracking activities using the addin is very easy but staff have to understand the importance/need of this. The Department of Health may require interaction summaries between your PHN and your practices. If this is indeed the case for your PHN, staff should be made aware that tracking is a requirement.
