## Account

Account records contain information about the companies you do business with.

The general concept is that the account is a single location and the contacts related to the account are those who work at that location. Accounts can be related to each other such as one account is headquarters (parent account) and sub-accounts are the multiple locations.

### How are accounts (organisations) categorised?

An organisation (account) has a field called 'Account Types', which contains values such as 'General Practice', 'Hospital', 'Specialist', 'Allied Health', 'Pharmacy' etc. Using this field you can filter accounts to show just 'General Practices'.

## Activity Category <img src="../img/activity_category.png" />

Activity Categories allow PHN staff to extract/report activity summaries based on 'topics'. 

Emails, Phone Calls, Appointments and Tasks can be assigned an 'Activity Category' (for example, 'My Health Record'). Staff can then export activity reports for an activity category.

A single email/call can only have a single Activity Category. If for example, a staff member records an appointment with a Practice and discusses multiple projects/topics, the staff member should either select the 'primary' Activity Category, or an Activity Category record is created and used to represent a range of topics usually covered during meetings with practices.
