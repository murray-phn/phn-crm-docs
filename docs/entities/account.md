# Account

Account records contain information about the companies you do business with.

The general concept is that the account is a single location and the contacts related to the account are those who work at that location. Accounts can be related to each other such as one account is headquarters (parent account) and sub-accounts are the multiple locations.

### How are organisations (accounts) categorised?

An organisation (account) has a field called 'Account Types', which contains values such as 'General Practice', 'Hospital', 'Specialist', 'Allied Health', 'Pharmacy' etc. Using this field you can filter accounts to show just 'General Practices'.
