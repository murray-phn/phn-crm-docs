Activity Categories allow PHN staff to extract/report activity summaries based on 'topics'. 

Emails, Phone Calls, Appointments and Tasks can be assigned an 'Activity Category' (for example, 'My Health Record'). Staff can then export activity reports for an activity category.

A single email/call can only have a single Activity Category. If for example, a staff member records an appointment with a Practice and discusses multiple projects/topics, the staff member should either select the 'primary' Activity Category, or an Activity Category record is created and used to represent a range of topics usually covered during meetings with practices.
