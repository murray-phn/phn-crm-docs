# Geographical Entities

PHN CRM contains thousands of records that each represent a single geographical boundary of a type.

Each boundary can be viewed on a map.

Some boundary types are linked to others. For example, you can see a list of SA1s contained in an SA2. POA (Postcodes) are linked to SSCs (Suburbs) and Suburbs are linked to LGAs. This linkage of data increases reporting capabilities.
