# Auditing

Any entity can have auditing enabled. This means that all changes to that entity are logged and viewable to others. 

Each audit record displays:

- What field was changed
- When it was changed
- Who changed it
- Its old value
- Its new value

You can filter the audit log to display changes to a single field, rather than all fields.

To enable or disable auditing on an entity, contact your PHN Exchange coordinator.
